# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Use the standard libraries in python.
2. Set variables for assigning dataset values.
3. Import LinearRegression from the sklearn.
4. Assign the points for representing the graph.
5. Predict the regression for marks by using the representation of the graph.
6. Compare the graphs and hence we obtain the LinearRegression for the given
data.

## Program:
